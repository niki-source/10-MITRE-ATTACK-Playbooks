# 10-MITRE-ATTACK-Playbooks
A collection of 10 SOC-focused detection playbooks mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, demonstrating alert triage, log analysis, correlation, and response workflows using SIEM and EDR data.

## This repository contains 10 MITRE ATT&CK–aligned detection playbooks designed to simulate real-world SOC analyst and detection engineering workflows.

Each playbook maps a specific ATT&CK technique to:

* Relevant log sources (EDR, SIEM, network, authentication)
* Detection logic (Sigma-style logic or SIEM queries)
* Investigation steps and alert correlation
* Triage decisions and response actions

The goal of this project is to demonstrate hands-on experience with threat detection, alert analysis, and incident response in a SOC environment.
